<p>I am currently one of the Research Fellows at NHS Education for Scotla=
nd, and I'm contacting you as one of the previous fellows at NES.  I was =
hoping to get your views on your Fellowship.</p>

<p>I have been asked to conduct an evaluation of the fellowships, and as =
part of this, I have prepared a brief questionnaire which I would be very=
 grateful if you could consider answering.</p>

<p>We hope to use the answers to this questionnaire to determine the main=
 areas in which the fellowships are perceived to have been useful by the =
fellows, and also ways in which they could be improved. You input would t=
herefore be invaluable; if you do feel able to contribute, I would be gra=
teful if you could do so by <b>30 January 2010</b></p>
